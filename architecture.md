# 🏗️ System Architecture & SOLID Blueprints

This document outlines the software engineering principles and component separations applied across the **RAG Graph Explorer** architecture.

## 🗺️ High-Level Component Topology

To ensure that processing gigabytes of text files never freezes the editor, the application is strictly decoupled into three layers:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Client [TODO : Presentation Layer - Webview UI iFrame]
        Canvas[webview.html Canvas] --> Ctrl[ui.controller.js Engine]
        Ctrl <--> Memory[state.manager.js Local State]
        Memory --> Modules[report-tab.js / tree-view-tab.js]
    end

    subgraph Host [Application Layer - VS Code Node.js Process]
        Router[message.router.ts Switchboard]
        History[history.service.ts JSON I/O]
        Orchestrator[export-orchestrator.service.ts]
        Env[config.service.ts Workspace Provider]
    end

    subgraph Execution [Worker Layer - Isolated Native OS Shell]
        Core[files-exporter.py CLI Core]
        Stream[Regex Scanner & Text Streamer]
        Disk[(Host File System OS)]
    end

    Router <--> History
    Router <--> Env
    Router --> Orchestrator
    Orchestrator -->|spawn async child_process| Core
    Core --> Stream
    Stream <--> Disk

## 🧩 Architectural Layer Responsibilities

### 1. Presentation Layer (WebView Framework)

Runs inside a sandbox environment managed by VS Code.

* **Strict Theme Compliance**: `webview.html` avoids hardcoded hex color codes. It utilizes standard VS Code theme tokens (e.g., `var(--vscode-editor-background)`) to ensure the tool adapts perfectly to light, dark, or high-contrast user setups.
* **State Encapsulation**: `state.manager.js` retains a lightweight in-memory mirror of the parameters currently visible on screen.
* **Component Isolation**: Each workspace section ...

### 2. Application Layer (TypeScript Host Services)

Operates inside the core extension process.

* **`message.router.ts`**: Implements a decoupled messaging pattern. It receives JSON data packets from the webview, unpacks them, and routes the work to specific services.
* **`history.service.ts`**: Manages profile persistence. It reads and writes profile data atomically using `JSON.stringify`, preventing corruption if an export run is canceled midway.
* **`export-orchestrator.service.ts`**: Validates form inputs, maps UI options into rigorous terminal line parameters, and prepares the command context.

### 3. Worker Execution Layer (Python Engine)

Operates as an independent native operating system sub-process.

* **Memory Safety & Efficiency**: The Python `xxxxx.py`  ??????

## 🔄 Two-Way Asynchronous State Synchronization

Maintaining clean data synchronization between the visual iFrame window and the backend host process is vital. Here is how the bidirectional pipeline works:

1. When a user types a path or clicks a setting, a `change` event fires, updating `state.manager.js`.
2. The UI pushes a `syncPaths` packet across the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) bridge.
3. The TypeScript backend catches this packet and immediately updates its internal workspace tracking state (`ExtensionState`).
